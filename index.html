<ul>
	<li>I polished my previous game in several ways. First, I <em>had</em> to make the game more organized,and re-playable, so I added game states.
	Now there is a preload, a main menu, and a reset button to bring you back to the menu. This makes for a more presentable, and fluid game.
	Also, I implemented the option to play as two different characters (Richio and Dinio). These players have different physics similar to the old
	Mario and Luigi dynamic in Super Mario Bros, which this game is obviously influenced by. Finally, I made the game more challenging by adding 
	more enemies -- squirrels that jump up and down at different heights. The game will undoubtedly take players several times to beat. (I also updated with some neat new sound effects)
	<em>ENJOY!</em></li>

<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {
	//	Create your Phaser game and inject it into the gameContainer div.
	//	We did it in a window.onload event, but you can do it anywhere (requireJS load, anonymous function, jQuery dom ready, - whatever floats your boat)
	var game = new Phaser.Game(1024, 520, Phaser.AUTO, 'gameContainer');
	//	Add the States your game has.
	//	You don't have to do this in the html, it could be done in your Boot state too, but for simplicity I'll keep it here.
